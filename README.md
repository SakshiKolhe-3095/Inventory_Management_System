## üíª Technology Stack

### Frontend

  * **React.js:** A powerful JavaScript library for building a dynamic and component-based user interface.
  * **React Router DOM:** For handling client-side routing.
  * **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for building a fully responsive and customizable design system.
  * **Axios:** A robust, promise-based HTTP client for asynchronous API requests.

### Backend

  * **Node.js:** The JavaScript runtime environment powering the server-side logic.
  * **Express.js:** A minimal and flexible Node.js framework for building a scalable RESTful API.
  * **Mongoose:** An elegant Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, providing schema validation and simplifying database interactions.
  * **bcrypt.js:** A library used for securely hashing and salting passwords before storing them.
  * **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** For a stateless, secure authentication flow between the server and client.

### Database

  * **MongoDB:** A NoSQL, document-based database for flexible and high-performance data storage.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

This application operates on a classic **MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)** stack architecture.

1.  **Frontend:** The user interacts with the React application, which handles all UI rendering, user input, and state management.
2.  **API Communication:** The frontend sends asynchronous HTTP requests (e.g., `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) to the backend API via Axios.
3.  **Backend:** The Node.js/Express.js server receives these requests. It processes the logic, authenticates the user, and uses Mongoose to interact with the MongoDB database.
4.  **Database:** MongoDB stores all the application's data‚Äîincluding products, transactions, and user information‚Äîin JSON-like documents.
5.  **Response:** The backend sends a JSON response back to the frontend, which then updates the UI in real-time.

This modular design ensures a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to maintain, debug, and scale.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

  * **Node.js** (v18+)
  * **npm** (comes with Node.js)
  * **MongoDB** (local installation or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)
  * **Git**

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/SakshiKolhe-3095/Inventory_Management_System.git
    cd Inventory_Management_System
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**

    ```sh
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

    Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add your MongoDB connection string and a secure JWT secret:

    ```
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
    PORT=5000
    ```

3.  **Frontend Setup:**

    ```sh
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**

    ```sh
    cd server
    npm start
    ```

    The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend App:**
    In a new terminal, navigate to the `client` directory:

    ```sh
    cd ../client
    npm start
    ```

    The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
